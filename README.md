# E-Bike Share Business Analysis

## Overview
Comprehensive business analysis of an e-bike sharing service using operational data from 15,000+ rides across multiple stations. This project identifies key demand patterns, customer segmentation insights, and infrastructure optimization opportunities.

## Key Findings
- **Dual peak demand**: 7 AM and 3 PM commuter patterns
- **Customer segmentation**: Casual users (long rides) vs. Subscribers (short commutes)
- **Network imbalance**: 116-bike daily directional flow requiring rebalancing
- **Growth plateau**: User acquisition declining after initial viral growth

## Recommendations
Strategic initiatives including dynamic pricing, tiered memberships, capacity expansion, and partnership programs projecting 30-40% revenue growth potential.
